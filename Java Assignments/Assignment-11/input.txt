In software development, agile (sometimes written Agile) practices include requirements discovery and solutions improvement through the
 collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams with their customer(s)/end user(s), adaptive planning, evolutionary
  development, early delivery, continual improvement, and flexible responses to changes in requirements, capacity, and understanding of the
   problems to be solved.

Popularized in the 2001 Manifesto for Agile Software Development,these values and principles were derived from and underpin a broad range
of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.
